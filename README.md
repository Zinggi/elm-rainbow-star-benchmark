# Rainbow Star Webgl and Math Benchmark

This is a small experimental benchmark to compare [linear-algebra](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/linear-algebra/latest) and [webgl-math](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Zinggi/elm-webgl-math/latest) in a somewhat more realistic scenario than purely in a benchmark.

I wouldn't trust the fps numbers that the benchmark displays, they're not accurate.

[Here](https://zinggi.github.io/randomDemos/webgl/rainbow_star_benchmark.html)'s a live version.
